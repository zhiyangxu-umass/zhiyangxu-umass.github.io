I am a first year Ph. D. student in the Computer Science Department, at Virginia Tech advised by [Prof. Lifu Huang](https://wilburone.github.io/). Previously I obtained my MS degree in Computer Science from Umass Amherst where I worked at [IESL](http://www.iesl.cs.umass.edu/). I obtained my BS degree in Computer Systems Engineering from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.

Research Interests
======
My primary research intersts are in Natural Language Processing and Semi-supervised Learning. I am especially intersted in extracting structured and actionable knowledge with limited supervision.
